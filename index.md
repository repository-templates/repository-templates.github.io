# An easy start to a project

The repository templates organization offers an ever-expanding
collection of GitHub templates to choose from.

## How to use a template

1. Go to the [repository templates GitHub page][github-page] and choose
   the repository that suits your needs.
2. Click the `Use this template` button.

3. Finally, type a name, description and set the privacy settings
   just as you usually would do when creating a new repository.

Once you have used a template once, it should appear in a dropdown
list directly on the new repository page for easy access when creating
future projects.
