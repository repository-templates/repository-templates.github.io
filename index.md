# An easy start to a project

The repository templates organization offers an ever-expanding
collection of GitHub templates to choose from.

## What are GitHub Templates?

Templates were recently introduced to GitHub. More information can be
found in their [blog post][templates-blog-post].

## How to use a template

1. Go to the [repository templates GitHub page][github-page] and choose
   the repository that suits your needs.
2. Click the `Use this template` button.

3. Finally, type a name, description and set the privacy settings
   just as you usually would do when creating a new repository.

Once you have used a template once, it should appear in a dropdown
list directly on the new repository page for easy access when creating
future projects.

A detailed breakdown of GitHub templates can be found
on the [GitHub help page][github-use-template-help].

## Requesting a new template

New templates can be requested by creating an issue in the [requests repository][requests-page].
You can also [send us an email][contact-email] if you're willing to contribute code to a new template
or join our development team. Don't forget to include your GitHub username.
